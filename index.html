        <p>
          I don’t know how to explain what you mean to me,
          but my world feels right only when you’re in it.<br><br>

          In my worst days, you were my calm.
          In my silence, you understood me.
          In my happiness, you became the reason.<br><br>

          I don’t promise perfection,
          but I promise effort, honesty,
          and a heart that always chooses you.<br><br>

          Happy Birthday, my love.
          You are my today, and every tomorrow ❤️
